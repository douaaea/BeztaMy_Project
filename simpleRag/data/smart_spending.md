# Smart Spending & Lifestyle (Morocco)

Living well in Morocco isn't about spending more; it's about mastering the duality of the economy: the Modern (Malls, Apps) vs. the Traditional (Souks, Hanouts). This guide helps you navigate both to maximize value.

## 1. The "Souk vs. Supermarket" Battle
Knowing where to buy what can save you 30-40% on your monthly grocery bill.

### The Supermarket (Marjane, Carrefour, Aswak Assalam)
*   **Buy Here**:
    *   *Cleaning Products*: Detergents, Bleach (Javel).
    *   *Dry Goods*: Pasta, Rice, Oil, Sugar, Flour (Fixed prices).
    *   *Dairy*: Milk, Yogurt, Cheese.
    *   *Promotions*: Look for "3 for 2" deals on non-perishables.
*   **Avoid Here**:
    *   *Fruits & Veg*: Often 50% more expensive and less fresh than the Souk.
    *   *Spices*: Overpriced packaged spices.

### The Souk / Marché
*   **Buy Here**:
    *   *Produce*: Potatoes (3-5 DH/kg vs 8 DH), Tomatoes, Onions.
    *   *Meat*: Butcher (Guezzar) minces meat in front of you. Fresher.
    *   *Spices*: Buy whole cumin/pepper and have them ground. Better flavor, cheaper.
    *   *Olives/Pickles*: A fraction of the jarred price.
*   **Strategy**: Go weekly. Build a relationship with a specific vendor. They will give you the best cuts/produce.

### The "Hanout" (Corner Store)
*   **Role**: Convenience.
*   **The "Carnet" (Credit)**: Many Hanouts offer informal credit.
    *   *Danger*: It feels free until the end of the month. Avoid using the Carnet unless necessary.
*   **Pricing**: Slightly higher than Marjane, but saves transport costs for small items (Bread, Milk).

## 2. Digital Tools & Apps for Savings
*   **Jumia**: Use it as a price checker. Before buying a phone at Derb Ghallef or a Mall, check the Jumia price.
*   **Avito**: The secondary market is huge.
    *   *Buy*: Furniture, Electronics, Cars.
    *   *Sell*: Declutter your home. That old heater is worth 300 DH.
*   **Glovo / Kaalix / Jumia Food**:
    *   *The Cost*: Delivery fee (10-20 DH) + Menu Markups (prices are often higher in-app).
    *   *Rule*: Delete the app if you are in debt. It is a wealth destroyer.
*   **Hmizate / Superdeal**: Look for coupons for Spas, Restaurants, and Activities.

## 3. Transportation Hacks
*   **Petit Taxi**:
    *   *Rule*: Always ask for the meter ("Compteur"). If they refuse, walk away or negotiate a price *lower* than the meter estimate.
    *   *Night*: +50% surcharge after 8pm/9pm.
*   **Grand Taxi**:
    *   *Role*: Fixed routes, shared. Very cheap (5-10 DH) for long distances within city.
*   **Tramway (Casa/Rabat)**:
    *   *Subscription*: 60 DH/week or 230 DH/month. Much cheaper than daily tickets (6-8 DH).
*   **Train (ONCF)**:
    *   *Advance Booking*: Buying a TGV ticket 2 weeks early is 50% cheaper than same-day.

## 4. Lifestyle Inflation: The "M'as-tu vu" Culture
Morocco has a strong culture of social signaling (appearing wealthy).

### The Car Trap
*   **Pressure**: "You are a manager now, you need a German car."
*   **Reality**: A used Dacia or Renault gets you from A to B. Parts are cheap. Mechanics know how to fix them.
*   **Cost**: A BMW breakdown can cost 10,000 DH. A Dacia breakdown costs 500 DH.

### The Café Culture
*   **Math**: 1 Coffee (15 DH) + Water (5 DH) + Tip (2 DH) = 22 DH.
*   **Frequency**: Twice a day = 44 DH.
*   **Monthly**: 1,320 DH.
*   **Fix**: Limit to one social coffee. Drink office coffee or make it at home.

### Weddings & Gifts
*   **Pressure**: Giving large sums to show generosity.
*   **Fix**: Give what you can afford. True friends/family value your presence.
*   **Outfit**: Renting a high-end Caftan (500 DH) is smarter than buying one (3,000 DH) you wear once.

## 5. Energy & Utility Savings
*   **Butane Gas (Boutagaz)**:
    *   *Subsidized*: A 12kg bottle costs ~40 DH but the real cost is ~140 DH. The state pays the rest.
    *   *Use*: Cooking and Water Heating (Chauffe-eau à gaz) is much cheaper than electricity.
*   **Electricity (Tiered Pricing)**:
    *   *Tranches*: The price per kWh jumps significantly if you cross thresholds (100 kWh, 150 kWh).
    *   *LEDs*: Replace all bulbs.
    *   *AC*: Run it at 24°C, not 18°C. Every degree costs money.

## 6. Telecom & Internet
*   **Mobile Plans**: Competition is fierce (Iam, Orange, Inwi).
    *   *Switching*: Don't be loyal. If Inwi offers 50GB for 99 DH and you pay 200 DH, switch. Keep your number.
*   **Fiber Optic**:
    *   *Standard*: 500 DH/month.
    *   *Sharing*: In some buildings, neighbors share a connection (though technically against TOS, it is common).

## 7. Medical Savings
*   **Generic Drugs (Génériques)**:
    *   *Rule*: Always ask the pharmacist for the "Générique". It is the same molecule but 30-50% cheaper.
    *   *Reimbursement*: AMO/Mutuelle reimburses based on the generic price anyway.
*   **Public Hospitals (CHU)**: For major surgeries, CHUs have excellent professors, though comfort is lower than clinics.

## 8. Vacation on a Budget
*   **Shoulder Season**: September/October in the North (Tetouan/Tangier) is beautiful and half price compared to August.
*   **Camping**: A growing trend in Morocco. Very cheap.
*   **Family Homes**: Staying with family is the ultimate Moroccan travel hack. Bring a nice gift (Sugar, Meat, Fruits) instead of paying for a hotel.
