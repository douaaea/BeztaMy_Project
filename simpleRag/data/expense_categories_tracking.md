# Expense Categories & Tracking (Morocco)

A comprehensive guide to categorizing and tracking personal expenses in the Moroccan context. This document helps you organize your spending into meaningful categories, understand what expenses to track, and implement effective tracking systems for better financial management and budgeting.

## 1. Standard Expense Categories

Understanding how to categorize your expenses is fundamental to effective money management. Categories help you see where your money goes, identify spending patterns, and make informed decisions about budget allocation.

### Fixed Expenses (Needs)

Fixed expenses are predictable, recurring costs that are essential for maintaining your basic standard of living. These expenses remain relatively constant month-to-month and are typically non-negotiable.

**Housing**
Housing represents your shelter costs and is typically the largest fixed expense in any budget. This category includes:
- Rent or mortgage payment (your monthly housing cost)
- Syndic fees (building maintenance fees charged by property management)
- Property tax (if you own your home)

**Utilities**
Utilities are essential services required for daily living. These costs power your home and keep you connected:
- Electricity (LYDEC/REDAL/AMENDIS - varies by region and consumption)
- Water (municipal water service charges)
- Internet and TV subscription (fiber optic or 4G box connectivity)
- Gas (Butane bottles for cooking and water heating)

**Insurance**
Insurance provides financial protection against unexpected events and is a critical component of financial security:
- Health insurance (Mutuelle - supplementary coverage beyond AMO)
- Car insurance (mandatory third-party liability plus optional comprehensive)
- Home insurance (protects your property and belongings)

**Debt Obligations**
Debt payments are contractual obligations that must be met to avoid penalties and maintain good credit standing:
- Credit card minimum payments (required monthly payment to avoid late fees)
- Consumer loans (Crédit conso - personal loans for purchases)
- Car loan installments (monthly payment for vehicle financing)
- Mortgage principal + interest (home loan repayment)

### Variable Expenses (Needs)

Variable expenses are essential costs that fluctuate month-to-month based on usage and consumption. While necessary for daily living, these expenses can be optimized through conscious choices and behavioral changes.

**Food & Groceries**
Food is a fundamental need but offers significant opportunity for budget optimization through smart shopping strategies:
- Supermarket purchases (Marjane, Carrefour - packaged goods and staples)
- Souk/market shopping (fresh produce, meat - typically 30-50% cheaper than supermarkets)
- Hanout (corner store) items (convenience purchases for daily needs)
- Butcher and bakery (fresh meat and bread from specialized vendors)

**Transportation**
Transportation costs vary based on commute distance, mode of transport, and frequency of travel:
- Taxi fares (Petit Taxi for short trips, Grand Taxi for shared longer routes)
- Tramway or bus subscription (monthly passes offer significant savings over daily tickets)
- Train tickets (ONCF - advance booking can save 50% on TGV routes)
- Car fuel and maintenance (variable based on usage and vehicle type)
- Parking fees (daily or monthly parking costs in urban areas)

**Healthcare**
Healthcare expenses cover medical needs beyond insurance coverage and preventive care:
- Doctor visits (net cost after AMO/Mutuelle reimbursement)
- Pharmacy and medications (always ask for generic alternatives to save 30-50%)
- Dental care (often not fully covered by insurance)
- Medical tests and laboratory work (diagnostic services)

**Communications**
Communication costs for staying connected in personal and professional life:
- Mobile phone recharges (IAM, Orange, Inwi prepaid or postpaid plans)
- Data packages (additional internet data beyond base plan)

### Discretionary Expenses (Wants)

Discretionary expenses are non-essential purchases that enhance quality of life but are not required for basic survival. These categories offer the most flexibility for budget cuts when needed and are prime areas for lifestyle inflation.

**Dining & Entertainment**
Social and recreational spending that brings enjoyment but can quickly spiral out of control:
- Restaurants and cafés (social dining and café culture - track closely as this is a common budget leak)
- Food delivery (Glovo, Jumia Food - convenience comes with delivery fees and menu markups)
- Cinema and events (movies, concerts, cultural activities)
- Streaming services (Netflix, Shahid, Spotify - subscription costs add up)

**Personal Care**
Appearance and grooming expenses that vary widely based on personal preferences:
- Barber or salon (haircuts, styling, beauty treatments)
- Beauty products (cosmetics, skincare, fragrances)
- Clothing and shoes (fashion purchases beyond basic necessities)
- Accessories (jewelry, watches, bags)

**Recreation**
Activities and hobbies that provide entertainment and personal fulfillment:
- Gym membership (fitness center subscriptions or class packages)
- Hobbies and sports (equipment, lessons, club fees)
- Weekend trips (short getaways and domestic tourism)

### Savings & Investments

Savings and investments represent money set aside for future security and wealth building. This category is crucial for long-term financial health and achieving major life goals.

**Emergency Fund**
A financial safety net for unexpected expenses or income disruption:
- Target: 3-6 months of essential expenses
- Keep in accessible account (Livret d'épargne for liquidity)
- Build gradually through automatic monthly transfers

**Retirement**
Long-term savings for financial independence in later years:
- CIMR contributions (mandatory or voluntary retirement fund)
- PEA deposits (tax-advantaged investment account for stocks)
- OPCVM purchases (mutual funds for diversified investment)

**Goals**
- Down payment savings
- Education fund
- Major purchase fund

## 2. Morocco-Specific Categories

Morocco has unique cultural, religious, and administrative expenses that don't fit standard Western budgeting frameworks. Understanding and planning for these categories is essential for realistic budgeting in the Moroccan context.

### Cultural & Religious

**Ramadan Expenses**
The holy month of Ramadan brings significant changes to spending patterns and food costs:
- Extra grocery costs (food expenses typically spike 30-40% due to special Ramadan foods)
- Iftar ingredients (dates, chebakia, sellou, harira, and other traditional foods)
- Decorations and supplies (lanterns, table settings for hosting)
*Tracking tip*: Create separate budget line and plan ahead by buying non-perishables 2 months early

**Aid Al-Adha**
The Festival of Sacrifice is one of the largest annual expenses for Moroccan families:
- Sheep purchase (2,500-4,500 DH depending on size and quality)
- Butcher fees (processing and preparation costs)
- Clothing and gifts (new clothes for family members, gifts for relatives)
*Tracking tip*: Save 300-500 DH monthly year-round to avoid taking "Crédit Mouton" loans

**Wedding Gifts**
Moroccan wedding culture involves significant financial obligations for guests:
- Gift money (500-1,000 DH per wedding is customary)
- Outfit rental or purchase (caftan rental 500-1,000 DH, purchase 2,000+ DH)
- Transportation (travel to wedding venues, often in other cities)
*Tracking tip*: Budget 2,000-5,000 DH for summer wedding season (June-September peak)

**Family Support**
Supporting parents and extended family is a cultural expectation in Moroccan society:
- Regular parent support (monthly contributions to parents' household)
- Sibling assistance (helping younger siblings with education or living costs)
- Emergency family help (unexpected family needs and crises)
*Tracking tip*: Budget as fixed expense for consistency and set clear expectations with family

### Administrative

**Official Documents**
Government paperwork and legal documents require fees and processing costs:
- Carte Grise renewal (vehicle registration renewal)
- Passport and ID renewal (national identity documents)
- Certificates and attestations (official documents for various purposes)
- Notary fees (legal document authentication and contracts)

**Banking Fees**
Moroccan banks charge various fees that can add up if not monitored:
- Account maintenance (20-30 DH/month for standard accounts)
- Transfer fees (10-20 DH per transfer depending on method)
- Inter-bank ATM fees (6.60 DH each time you use another bank's ATM)
- Card annual fees (debit and credit card yearly charges)
*Optimization target*: Keep total banking fees under 50 DH/month by using your own bank's ATMs and digital transfers

## 3. Tracking Best Practices

### Category Assignment Rules

**Need vs. Want Test**
Ask: "Would not having this threaten my job, health, housing, or safety?"
- Yes → Need
- No → Want

**Splitting Mixed Purchases**
- Supermarket trip with groceries + snacks → Split into Food (Need) and Treats (Want)
- Pharmacy with medicine + cosmetics → Split into Healthcare (Need) and Personal Care (Want)

**Handling Cash Purchases**
- Log immediately after spending
- Use receipt photos for accountability
- End-of-day wallet reconciliation

### Tracking Frequency

**Daily**
- Record all cash transactions
- Photo receipts from Souk vendors
- Check wallet balance vs. logged spending

**Weekly**
- Review spending by category
- Identify top 3 expense categories
- Spot unusual transactions

**Monthly**
- Calculate percentage per category
- Compare to budget targets
- Identify optimization opportunities

## 4. Common Tracking Mistakes

### The "Miscellaneous" Trap
**Problem**: Using "Misc" for 10%+ of spending
**Fix**: Force sub-categorization
- "Misc" should be <5% of total spending
- If higher, you're avoiding proper tracking

### Cash Blindspot
**Problem**: ATM withdrawal = 1 transaction, but represents 10+ purchases
**Fix**: Log each cash purchase separately
- Track what the cash was actually spent on
- Don't just record "ATM withdrawal 500 DH"

### Seasonal Amnesia
**Problem**: Forgetting predictable seasonal expenses
**Fix**: Create "Seasonal" category with monthly contributions
- August vacation
- September school costs
- December holidays

### Category Creep
**Problem**: Reclassifying Wants as Needs to justify spending
**Fix**: Strict category definitions
- Café with client → Business expense
- Café for leisure → Entertainment (Want)
- Don't rationalize discretionary spending

## 5. Category Benchmarks by Income

### Junior Salary (8,000-12,000 DH)

## 6. Integration with Budgeting

### Link to 50/30/20 Rule
1. Sum all "Needs" categories → Should be ≤50%
2. Sum all "Wants" categories → Should be ≤30%
3. Sum all "Savings" categories → Should be ≥20%

### Variance Analysis
**Monthly Formula**:
```
Variance = Budgeted Amount - Actual Spending
```

**Actions**:
- Positive variance (under budget) → Roll to savings
- Negative variance → Investigate and adjust next month
- Consistent overspending → Increase budget or cut spending

### Red Flags
- Housing >50% of income → Housing crisis risk
- Debt payments >40% of income → Debt emergency
- Dining out >15% of income → Major leak
- Untracked cash >20% of spending → Blind spot
- Banking fees >100 DH/month → Wrong bank or behavior
