# Investment Basics (Morocco Market)

Investing in Morocco has evolved significantly beyond traditional assets like land and gold. The Moroccan financial market is now mature, well-regulated by the AMMC (Autorité Marocaine du Marché des Capitaux), and accessible to individual investors through various channels including the Bourse de Casablanca, OPCVM (mutual funds), and tax-advantaged accounts like the PEA.

## 1. Why Invest? Inflation vs. Purchasing Power

Understanding the relationship between inflation and investment returns is crucial for protecting and growing your wealth over time.

*   **Inflation in Morocco**: Historically maintained at 2-3% annually, but recently spiked to 5-6% due to global economic pressures and local factors
*   **Savings Account (Livret d'épargne)**: Traditional savings accounts pay approximately 1.5% - 3% annual interest
*   **The Math**: If inflation is running at 5% and your savings account pays only 2%, you are effectively **losing 3% of your purchasing power** every year - your money buys less even though the number stays the same
*   **The Investment Goal**: Achieve returns that beat inflation (target >5% annual return) to maintain and grow real purchasing power

## 2. Asset Classes in Morocco

**The main asset classes available for investment in Morocco are:**
