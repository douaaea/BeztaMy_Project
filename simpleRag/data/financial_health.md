# Financial Health & Debt Management (Morocco)

True financial health in Morocco is about more than just having money; it's about navigating the social security system (CNSS), understanding your rights (AMO), and managing debt in a high-interest environment.

## 1. The Social Security Pillar (CNSS & AMO)
Many Moroccans ignore their CNSS until it's too late. This is the foundation of your safety net.

### Retirement (The 3,240 Days Rule)
*   **The Basics**: To get a "full" pension, you historically needed **3,240 days** of declared work (approx 10.8 years).
*   **The New Rule (2025)**: A partial pension is now available from **1,320 days**.
*   **The Calculation Formula**:
    *   `Pension = (Average Salary of last 96 months) x Rate`
    *   *Capped Salary*: The calculation base is capped at **6,000 DH**. Even if you earn 20,000 DH, CNSS calculates on 6,000 DH.
    *   *Base Rate*: 50% for the first 3,240 days.
    *   *Bonus*: +1% for every 216 days extra.
    *   *Max*: 70% (4,200 DH/month).
*   **Reality Check**: The maximum CNSS pension is **4,200 DH/month**. You cannot live comfortably on this in Casablanca. You **must** have a supplementary pension (CIMR or Private).

### AMO (Assurance Maladie Obligatoire)
*   **Coverage**: Typically 70% of the "Tarif National de Référence" (TNR).
*   **The Gap**: The TNR is often lower than the real price.
    *   *Doctor Visit*: TNR is 150 DH. Real price is 300 DH. AMO reimburses 70% of 150 (105 DH). You pay 195 DH.
*   **Mutuelle (Private Insurance)**: This covers the difference. Always prioritize a job that offers a good Mutuelle (RMA, AXA, Wafa, MCMA).

## 2. Housing Aid: "Daam Sakan" (2024-2028)
The government now offers **Direct Financial Aid** for first-time buyers.

### Eligibility
*   Moroccan nationality (including MRE).
*   No other property owned in Morocco.
*   Property must be **New** (Permis d'habiter > Jan 2023).
*   Price < 700,000 DH.

### The Amounts
1.  **Housing < 300,000 DH**: Aid of **100,000 DH**.
    *   *Impact*: You buy a 250k apartment. You pay 150k. State pays 100k.
2.  **Housing 300,000 DH - 700,000 DH**: Aid of **70,000 DH**.
    *   *Impact*: You buy a 600k apartment. You pay 530k. State pays 70k.

### Process
*   Register on `daamsakane.ma`.
*   Notary handles the transaction.
*   Must be your **Principal Residence** for 5 years.

## 3. Debt Management: The Moroccan Context
Debt is easy to get but hard to escape.

### Interest Rates (Taux)
*   **Crédit Conso (Consumer Loan)**: 6% - 12%.
    *   *Danger*: Often sold as "Easy Cash" via mobile apps.
*   **Crédit Auto**: 6% - 9%.
    *   *Leasing (LOA)*: Often higher effective rates but includes insurance/maintenance.
*   **Crédit Immobilier (Mortgage)**: 4.0% - 5.5%.
    *   *Variable vs Fixed*: In 2024, opt for **Fixed Rate**. Rates are relatively high, but variable is risky with global inflation.

### The "Centrale des Risques" (Bank Al-Maghrib)
*   **What it is**: A database of all your credits and unpaid incidents.
*   **Impact**: If you miss payments, you are "interdit de chéquier" (banned from checkbooks) or blacklisted from new loans.
*   **Check your status**: You can request your "Rapport de Solvabilité" from Bank Al-Maghrib once a year for free.

### Debt Payoff Strategies
1.  **The Avalanche (Mathematically Best)**:
    *   List debts by **Interest Rate**.
    *   Pay minimums on everything.
    *   Throw all extra cash at the *Highest Rate* (usually the Consumer Loan or Credit Card overdraft).
2.  **The Snowball (Psychologically Best)**:
    *   List debts by **Balance** (Smallest to Largest).
    *   Kill the smallest loan first (e.g., the 5,000 DH phone loan).
    *   The "Win" motivates you to tackle the next one.

## 4. Islamic Finance (Finance Participative)
For those avoiding Riba (Interest), "Participative Banks" (Umnia, Bank Assafa, etc.) offer alternatives.

### Mourabaha (Cost-Plus Financing)
*   **Mechanism**: The bank buys the house/car and resells it to you at a higher price, paid in installments.
*   **Pros**: Fixed cost. No uncertainty. Sharia compliant.
*   **Cons**: Often slightly more expensive than conventional loans (due to double registration fees, though laws are improving).
*   **Hamish Jidiya**: The "Serious Deposit" (Down payment) required is often higher (10-20%).

## 5. The Financial Health Checklist (Annual)
1.  **Check CNSS Points**: Login to `MaCNSS`. Are all your days declared? (Employers sometimes "forget").
2.  **Check CIMR**: If you contribute, check your points balance.
3.  **Review Insurance**: Is your car insurance competitive? (Switching can save 500-1,000 DH).
4.  **Net Worth Calculation**: Assets (House + Cash + Car) - Liabilities (Loans). Is it going up?

## 6. Emergency Fund (Fonds de Secours)
*   **Target**: 3 to 6 months of expenses.
*   **Where to keep it**:
    *   **Livret d'épargne**: 1.5% - 3% interest. Tax-free up to certain amounts.
    *   **Do not** keep it in your checking account (Compte Chèque) or you will spend it.
    *   **Do not** invest it in the Bourse (Stocks). It must be liquid and safe.
