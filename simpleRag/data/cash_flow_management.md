# Cash Flow Management Guide (Morocco)

Managing cash flow in Morocco is unique due to the dominance of the monthly pay cycle, the heavy reliance on cash (Cash on Delivery, Souks), and the massive financial impact of religious holidays (Ramadan, Aid Al-Adha). This guide provides a granular operating system for your money.

## 1. The Monthly Pay Cycle: Surviving the "30-Day Drought"
95% of Moroccan employees are paid monthly, usually between the 25th and the 30th. This creates a "Feast and Famine" dynamic.

### The "Rich on the 1st, Broke on the 20th" Syndrome
*   **Days 1-5**: You feel rich. You eat out, buy clothes, take "Petit Taxi" everywhere.
*   **Days 15-20**: You start checking your balance. You switch to "Grand Taxi" or Tram.
*   **Days 25-30**: You are borrowing money or using the overdraft (Découvert).

### The Fix: Artificial Weekly Paychecks
1.  **Calculate Discretionary Spending**: After Rent, Bills, and Savings, what is left? (e.g., 2,000 DH).
2.  **The Monday Withdrawal**: Every Monday morning, withdraw exactly 500 DH (2,000 / 4 weeks).
3.  **The Cash Envelope**: Put this 500 DH in your wallet. This is for Groceries, Café, Transport, and Fun.
4.  **The Rule**: When the 500 DH is gone, you stay home until next Monday. No card swiping.

## 2. Banking Fees & Optimization (2024 Comparison)
Moroccan banks are notorious for hidden fees ("Dates de valeur", "Frais de tenue de compte").

### Fee Comparison (Standard Accounts)
*   **Attijariwafa Bank**:
    *   *Account Fee*: ~25-30 DH/month.
    *   *Transfer (Agency)*: 20 DH.
    *   *Transfer (App)*: 10-15 DH.
*   **Banque Populaire (BP)**:
    *   *Account Fee*: ~20 DH/month.
    *   *Chaabi Net*: Extra subscription fee.
*   **CIH Bank (The Youth/Digital Favorite)**:
    *   *Code30 (Under 30yo)*: **Free** account fees. Free card.
    *   *Standard*: Lower fees than legacy banks.
    *   *App*: Best in class for transfers.
*   **CFG Bank**:
    *   *Positioning*: Premium. Higher fees but better service/ATMs.

### The "Date de Valeur" Trap
*   **Scenario**: You deposit a check on Friday. The money shows in your app. You spend it on Saturday.
*   **Reality**: The "Value Date" is Monday or Tuesday. You are technically in overdraft for 3 days.
*   **Cost**: Agios (Overdraft fees) are calculated at ~12-14% interest + fixed fees.
*   **Fix**: Never spend check money until 3 days *after* deposit.

### ATM Strategy
*   **Inter-bank Fee**: Withdrawing from an ATM that is *not* your bank costs **6.60 DH** per withdrawal.
*   **Impact**: If you withdraw 100 DH five times a month from a different bank, you lose 33 DH. That's a free coffee.
*   **Rule**: Only use your own bank's ATMs.

## 3. Religious & Seasonal Budgeting (The "Big Three")
In Morocco, your expenses are not flat. They spike massively 3 times a year.

### 1. Ramadan (The Food Spike)
*   **The Cost**: Food bills typically rise by **30-40%**.
*   **Why**: Chebakia, Sellou, elaborate Iftars, guests, "Table garnie".
*   **Budgeting**:
    *   *Example*: If normal groceries are 2,000 DH, Ramadan will be 3,000 DH.
    *   *Strategy*: Buy non-perishables (Flour, Oil, Honey, Almonds) 2 months before. Prices hike 20% the week before Ramadan.

### 2. Aid Al-Adha (The Sheep)
*   **The Cost**:
    *   *Sheep (Sardi)*: 2,500 DH - 4,500 DH.
    *   *Butcher/Supplies*: 500 DH.
    *   *Total*: ~3,000 - 5,000 DH.
*   **The Trap**: "Crédit Mouton" (Consumer loans for the sheep).
    *   *Interest*: Often advertised as 0% but has 200-300 DH "Frais de dossier".
*   **The Fix**: The "500 DH Rule". Save 500 DH/month for 6 months prior. Or 300 DH/month all year.

### 3. Summer / Wedding Season
*   **Weddings**: You will be invited.
    *   *Gift (Cadeau)*: 500 DH - 1,000 DH per wedding.
    *   *Outfit (Caftan)*: Rental (500-1,000 DH) or Purchase (2,000 DH+).
*   **Travel**: Domestic tourism (North, Marrakech) prices triple in August.
    *   *Strategy*: Book in May. Or travel in September.

## 4. Irregular Income Strategies (Freelancers/Auto-Entrepreneurs)
If you don't get a steady salary, the "Month End" doesn't exist.

### The "Hill and Valley" System
1.  **Calculate "Survival Number"**: Rent + Food + Bills (e.g., 6,000 DH).
2.  **Business Account**: All client payments go here. **Never** spend from here.
3.  **Personal Account**: Set up an automatic transfer of 6,000 DH on the 1st of the month.
4.  **The Buffer**:
    *   *Good Month (15,000 DH)*: You take 6,000. 9,000 stays in Business.
    *   *Bad Month (2,000 DH)*: You take 6,000. The Business account covers the gap.
5.  **Quarterly Bonus**: If the Business account grows too big (>3 months expenses), pay yourself a "Dividend/Bonus".

## 5. Managing "Black Tax" (Family Support)
In Moroccan culture, supporting parents or younger siblings is often non-negotiable.
*   **The Mistake**: Treating it as a surprise or "giving what I have left".
*   **The Fix**: Line Item Budgeting.
    *   *Rent*: 3,000 DH.
    *   *Food*: 2,000 DH.
    *   *Parents*: 1,000 DH.
*   **Communication**: Set expectations. "I can send 1,000 DH a month." Consistency is better than sporadic large sums.

## 6. Cash vs. Digital: When to use what
*   **Cash (Espèces)**:
    *   *Where*: Souk, Hanout (Corner store), Taxis, Plumbers/Electricians.
    *   *Why*: Negotiation power. "No tax" discount.
*   **Card (TPE)**:
    *   *Where*: Marjane, Carrefour, Zara, Gas Stations (Afriquia/Shell).
    *   *Why*: Tracking. It automatically categorizes in your app. Points/Miles (if premium card).
*   **Check (Chèque)**:
    *   *Where*: Rent, Large deposits, Doctors (sometimes).
    *   *Warning*: Issuing a check without funds is a **criminal offense** in Morocco (Prison). Never write a "Guarantee Check" (Chèque de garantie) - it is illegal but common.
