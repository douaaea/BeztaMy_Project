# Budgeting Strategies (Morocco Context)

Effective budgeting in Morocco requires balancing modern aspirations with local economic realities. This comprehensive guide applies proven global budgeting frameworks to the Moroccan context, providing specific price data, salary-based scenarios, and practical strategies for managing money in cities like Casablanca, Rabat, and Marrakech.

## 1. The 50/30/20 Rule: Adapted for Moroccan Salaries
The 50/30/20 budgeting rule is a simple framework that allocates your after-tax income into three categories: 50% for Needs (essential expenses), 30% for Wants (discretionary spending), and 20% for Savings and debt repayment. However, this standard rule requires significant adjustment based on Moroccan income levels and cost of living realities.

### Scenario A: The "Junior" (Salary: 8,000 DH Net)
**How to adapt the 50/30/20 rule for a junior salary of 8,000 DH:**
At this entry-level income bracket, essential needs often consume more than the standard 50% allocation due to high housing costs relative to income. Young professionals in this salary range typically work in entry-level positions in banking, IT, administration, or retail sectors.
*   **Needs (50% = 4,000 DH)**:
    *   *Rent*: 2,500 DH (Shared apartment in Maarif/Agdal or Studio in Oulfa/Hay Karima - housing is the largest expense)
    *   *Transport*: 500 DH (Tramway/Bus monthly subscription plus occasional Petit Taxi for emergencies)
    *   *Groceries*: 1,000 DH (Shopping primarily at Souk markets for fresh produce, minimal meat consumption to save money)
*   **Wants (30% = 2,400 DH)**:
    *   *Café/Snacks*: 800 DH (Social coffee culture - 1-2 café visits per day adds up quickly)
    *   *Shopping*: 800 DH (Clothing, personal items, occasional treats)
    *   *Outings*: 800 DH (Cinema, restaurants, weekend activities with friends)
*   **Savings (20% = 1,600 DH)**:
    *   *Emergency Fund*: 1,000 DH (Building a financial safety net for unexpected expenses)
    *   *Investments*: 600 DH (Starting small with OPCVM or PEA contributions for long-term wealth building)

### Scenario B: The "Manager" (Salary: 20,000 DH Net)
*   **Needs (45% = 9,000 DH)**:
    *   *Rent/Mortgage*: 5,000 DH (Nice 2-bedroom in decent neighborhood).
    *   *Car Loan*: 2,000 DH (Dacia/Clio).
    *   *Fuel/Insurance*: 1,000 DH.
    *   *Groceries*: 2,000 DH.
    *   *Utilities*: 1,000 DH.
*   **Wants (30% = 6,000 DH)**:
    *   *Restaurants*: 2,000 DH.
    *   *Travel/Weekend*: 2,000 DH.
    *   *Hobbies/Gym*: 1,000 DH.
    *   *Family Support*: 1,000 DH.
*   **Savings (25% = 5,000 DH)**:
    *   *Investments (Bourse/OPCVM)*: 3,000 DH.
    *   *Savings Account*: 2,000 DH.

### Housing: Rent vs. Buy
*   **Casablanca Prices (Average)**:
    *   *Gauthier/Racine*: 18,000 - 25,000 DH/m² (Buy) | 8,000 - 12,000 DH (Rent Studio).

*   **Rabat Prices**:
    *   *Agdal/Hay Riad*: 20,000 - 28,000 DH/m².
    *   *Hassan/Ocean*: 12,000 - 16,000 DH/m².
*   **Tangier**:
    *   *Malabata/Centre*: 13,000 - 18,000 DH/m².

### Schooling: The "Budget Killer"
If you have kids, this is likely your biggest stressor.
*   **Mission Française (AEFE/OSUI)**:
    *   *Tuition*: 40,000 - 60,000 DH / year per child.
    *   *Registration (1st year)*: 25,000 - 40,000 DH.
    *   *Impact*: For 2 kids, that's ~10,000 DH/month.
*   **Private Bilingue/Trilingue**:
    *   *Range*: 1,500 - 4,000 DH / month per child.
    *   *Quality*: Highly variable. Requires research.
*   **Public School**:
    *   *Cost*: Free.
    *   *Reality*: Often requires supplementary tutoring (Centre de soutien) costing 500-1,000 DH/month.

### Marriage: The "One Night" Budget
A traditional Moroccan wedding is a massive financial event.
*   **Budget Range**: 100,000 DH - 300,000 DH (Average).
*   **Breakdown (for ~150 guests)**:
    *   *Venue (Salle)*: 10,000 - 40,000 DH.
    *   *Catering (Traiteur)*: 3,000 - 4,000 DH per table (10 pax). Total: ~50,000 DH.
    *   *Negafa (Ziana)*: 10,000 - 30,000 DH.
    *   *Orchestra*: 15,000 - 30,000 DH.
    *   *Drib Sdak (Adoul)*: 2,000 DH.
*   **Strategy**: Do not go into debt for this. If you have 100k, spend 100k.

## 3. Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) in a Cash Economy
ZBB means Income - Expenses = 0. Every Dirham has a job.
*   **The "Envelope" Adaptation**:
    1.  Withdraw "Variable" budget in cash.
    2.  Label envelopes: "Souk", "Hamam", "Café", "Barber".
    3.  Put exact amounts in.
    4.  When "Café" envelope is empty, you drink water.
*   **Why it works**: You can't "swipe" an empty envelope. It stops impulse buying at Marjane.

## 4. Sinking Funds (Épargne de Précaution)
These are for "Predictable Surprises".
*   **Car Maintenance**:
    *   *Tires/Oil/Insurance*: ~5,000 DH/year.
    *   *Save*: 400 DH/month.
*   **Eid Al-Adha**:
    *   *Sheep*: ~3,000 DH.
    *   *Save*: 250 DH/month.
*   **Summer Holiday**:
    *   *Budget*: 10,000 DH.
    *   *Save*: 800 DH/month.

## 5. Cost of Living Benchmarks (2024)
Use these to sanity-check your spending.
*   **Groceries (Single)**: 1,500 - 2,000 DH/month.
*   **Groceries (Couple + 1 Kid)**: 3,500 - 5,000 DH/month.
*   **Electricity (Lydec/Redal)**:
    *   *Winter/Summer (AC/Heater)*: 500 - 800 DH.
    *   *Spring/Autumn*: 250 - 400 DH.
*   **Internet**:
    *   *Fiber (Orange/Maroc Telecom)*: 500 DH (100Mbps).
    *   *4G Box*: 200 - 300 DH.
*   **Gym**:
    *   *City Club/Passage*: 2,500 DH/year.
    *   *Premium*: 500 - 800 DH/month.

## 6. Tools & Apps
*   **Banking Apps**: CIH Mobile and Attijari Mobile allow you to categorize expenses.
*   **Excel/Sheets**: The best tool. Create a column for "Date", "Category", "Amount", "Cash/Card".
*   **Notebook (Carnet)**: For cash spenders, a small notebook in the pocket is more effective than an app.
